# plutonium_plugin_base
A plugin that has no code that hopefully compiles and the game will load it to do nothing. Stability not guaranteed.

Requires Git (https://git-scm.com/), Premake5 (https://premake.github.io/), and MSVC 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) to build.

# Installation
Move the `plutonium_plugin_base.dll` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\plugins\`, the plugin will be loaded when you start up a dedicated server for Plutonium.
